<!--Positioning Notes-->
<!--Children always sit on top of their parents elements-->

<!--Relative Positioning: Change position of an element relative to how it would have been naturally according to html-->
<!--With Relative positioning, the positioning of other element wouldn't change, the element with relative positioning will move over other elements and the place where it was before will be left empty, nothing will move into its place, that place is still sort of reserved for that element(like a ghost of its past position)-->

<!--Absolute Position: In this, we change the position of an element relative to its parent div, meaning if we give it a right:50px property, it will NOT move 50px to the right from its current position RATHER, it will move to the right edge of the parent div and leave 50px of space between the right edge and itself-->
<!--In abs positioning, the parent doesn't need to be the body, it can be any parent container with positioning set to relative-->
